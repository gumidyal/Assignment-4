Assignment 4 (Henry Firestone & Syamala Gumidyala)

Tests:
100 updates, 1 cooperator, 9 defectors, 0 partial – We predict that all the organisms will become defectors because there’s only one cooperator. Therefore, the average cooperation will be 0. The results support our prediction. 
Results: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 
Average: 0
100 updates, 9 cooperator, 1 defectors, 0 partial – We predict that all the organisms will become cooperators because there’s only one defector. Therefore, the average cooperation will be 0.
The mean was 1 not 0.
Results: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
Average: 1
100 updates, 3 cooperators, 3 defectors, 4 partial – We predict that the outcome will be all cooperators because cooperators are dominant. Therefore, the average cooperation will be 1.0. We were wrong it varied every time.
Results: .65, .35, .2, .4, .2, .4, .55, .5, .2, .5
Average: .395
100 updates, 33 cooperators, 33 defectors, 34 partial - We predict that the outcome will be all cooperators or all partial cooperators. Therefore, the average cooperation will be 1 or .5. We were wrong, the results were random.
Results: .71, .38, .63, .325, .45, .65, .48, .53, .305, .845
Average: .5305
100 updates, 1 cooperators, 99 defectors, 0 partial - We predict that the outcome will be all defectors because there is only one cooperator. Therefore, the average cooperation will be 0. The results support our prediction. 
Results: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 
Average: 0
100 updates, 99 cooperators, 1 defectors, 0 partial – We predict that the outcome will be all cooperators because there is only one defector. Therefore, the average cooperation will be 1. The results support our prediction. 
Results: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
Average: 1
